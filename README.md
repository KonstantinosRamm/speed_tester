# Speed Tester (C++)

# V2 branch under development

## ðŸš¨ **IT'S A BIG FAILURE** ðŸš¨

This project began with the naÃ¯ve belief that writing a speed tester in C++ using a public API would be easy. Spoiler alert: it wasn't. In fact, it was so far from easy that even the API itself didnâ€™t know what it was supposed to be doing. If you want to see what happens when bad planning, poor design choices,welcome to this dumpster fire.

### ðŸ¤¡ **What went wrong?**

- The **API** I chose didnâ€™t even have basic endpoints for download speeds. But why would I think that was important?
- This project is living proof that a lack of abstraction leads to a painful mess. Itâ€™s as if I wrote each line of code while simultaneously ignoring every best practice I had ever read about.
- The **main branch** is an ongoing **train wreck** of frustration, no developer should ever have to endure.

### ðŸ’¥ **Lessons learned?**

- Donâ€™t pick an API based on wishful thinking. Research it like a responsible adult.
- Abstraction is not a suggestion;
- Never let a project like this be your first impression on anyone. You will only be judged harshly, and rightly so.

### ðŸ”§ **Current Status**  
As of now, this project is a **failure** in its current form. If youâ€™re looking for something that works, stop reading now, because this is the place where good code goes to die. The code is an unholy combination of poor decision-making and a lack of understanding of basic networking principles.

### ðŸ“œ **Whatâ€™s next?**

The **`V2` branch** is still under development (thankfully), but thereâ€™s hope. If you want to see what happens when I actually try to be a competent developer, head over to the `V2` branch.

> **NOTE:** If you still want to laugh at the car crash that is this project, feel free to explore the `main` branch. But donâ€™t expect it to work. At all.
